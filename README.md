# Valheim on AWS (With Discord)

An AWS hosted Valheim game server for about $0.04/hr (USD)

## Storage

When not in use, game files live in version-enabled S3 is used for long-term storage.

Non-current versions are deleted after 10 days.

## Game Server

Runs on AWS ECS Fargate Spot instances using ephemeral storage.

Game files are re/de-hydrated from S3 on startup/shutdown.

If your spot instance is terminated â€”Â it takes about 3 minutes to restore (although I've never had this happen outside of testing), and unfortunately you get a new IP address. You shouldn't lose any data though, as the server performs a graceful shutdown and dehydrates your world onto S3.

## Usage

Requires:
- [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (recommended: use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating))
- Discord

### 1 - Create a webhook

This is for the server to push outbound notifications.

1. Right click your discord service icon
2. Click "Server Settings" > "Integrations"
3. "View Webhooks" > "New Webhook"
4. Click "Copy Webhook URL" (use this when deploying)

### 2 - Create a bot

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Click "New Application"
3. Click "Copy" on the public key (use this when deploying)

### 3 - Deploy

NOTE: You need an AWS account with appropriate authentication.

```shell
make build deploy
```

Follow the prompts.

### 4 - Set Discord bot interations URL

After deploy is complete, you should get a "API" value, copy this into your bot's "INTERACTIONS ENDPOINT URL"

You should now be able to use `/server` commands in your discord server

## Lambda commands

These are still available alongside the Discord bot options.

### Start

The following starts the service and returns the Public IP and Password.

```shell
aws lambda invoke --function-name ${STACK_NAME}-start /dev/stdout
```

NOTE: This is idempotent - your can re-run this to return the current IP and password.

### Stop

The following stops the service.

NOTE: The lambda waits until the service is inactive, an error may mean it's still running.

```shell
aws lambda invoke --function-name ${STACK_NAME}-stop /dev/stdout
```

### Offline backup

You may want to take an occasional offline backup.

```shell
aws s3 cp --recursive s3://BUCKET ./data
```

NOTE: Due to the global nature of S3 bucket names, it does not use `${STACK_NAME}`, but the lambda returns the value.

Local location:

## Decision Log

### Q: Hasn't this been done before?

A: Yes and no â€”Â I only found solutions using CDK.

CDK is really great if you work in a team who wants to provide abstractions to another team. Eg. Your tooling team wants to make it easy for devs to create company-approved solutions (ie. with the right security features enabled, tagging, etc).

It otherwise adds unnecessary steps.

### Q: Why Fargate?

A: Docker.

This solution leverages a huge amount of work put into the `lloesche/valheim-server-docker` image.

Fargate allows me to deploy that image into AWS without thinking about servers.

### Q: Why Secrets Manager?

A: Best Practice.

Honestly I'm on the fence on this one, you could save $0.40/month by just hard-coding a password into an env var.

ðŸ¤·

### Q: Why no static IP?

A: Cost.

Although you get 1 complimentary Elastic IP with new AWS accounts, it costs $0.12/day while not in use. That's 43.8/year which I've decided to avoid.

https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/

> To ensure efficient use of Elastic IP addresses, we impose a small hourly charge when these IP addresses are not associated with a running instance or when they are associated with a stopped instance or unattached network interface.

### Q: Why no DNS?

A: Cost.

That's $0.50/month for the Hosted Zone, plus maybe $12/year for a domain.
